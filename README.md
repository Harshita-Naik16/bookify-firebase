- Bootstrap
- Firebase

### Journey

- Used Firebase for the first time. It was challenging to structure everything well, so that I can add new features in the future.
- All the firebase code is stored in firebase.jsx file which is created using react context that is wrapped around whole app in main.jsx
- main.jsx is the entry point of our app where all the routing config is handled.
- Also tried react bootstrap for the first time. It sure has some good responsive components which eases the work of a developer and goes well with react.

### File Structure

- `src` - contains all the important folders
- `src/components` - has all the reusable components
- `src/lib` - contains reusable helper functions
- `src/pages` - contains all the pages which are handled by routing in main.jsx
- `src/store/firebase.jsx` - react context which stores all of the firebase configuration accessed throughout the app.
- `src/App.jsx` - Here the Navbar is made available as a common component throughout the app
- `src/main.jsx` - Entry point to our application linked to html file which is present in root folder.
- `src/index.css` - Css file, contains some custom styling for Loading component.
